# Contributing to this repository <!-- omit in toc -->

Before contributing, consider the following.

This is a mostly downstream repository. Upstream concerns package descriptions from [Manjaro ARM](https://manjaro.org/), slightly changed to fit Arch Linux ARM. If you have a bug or improvement for a package, please check first if it is relevant for [Manjaro ARM on Pinebook Pro](https://manjaro.org/download/). Every PKGBUILD in this repository contains a note at the top stating on which Manjaro ARM package description(s) it is based, which can be useful for narrowing down problems and suggesting improvements upstream. If it is relevant to Manjaro ARM, please go to the [Manjaro forum](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/about-the-manjaro-development-category/20), or submit your issue or merge request to the [Manjaro ARM repository](https://gitlab.manjaro.org/manjaro-arm).

The descriptions in this repository are automatically updated. All pull requests are denied since their changes would be automatically overwritten. You can open an issue if it relates exclusively to the package descriptions in this repository.
