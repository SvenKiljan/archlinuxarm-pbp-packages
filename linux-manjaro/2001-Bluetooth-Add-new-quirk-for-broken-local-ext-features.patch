Subject: [PATCH 1/8] Bluetooth: Add new quirk for broken local ext features max_page
Date: Fri, 18 Jan 2019 09:02:25 -0800
Message-Id: <20190118170232.16142-2-anarsoul@gmail.com>

Some adapters (e.g. RTL8723CS) advertise that they have more than
2 pages for local ext features, but they don't support any features
declared in these pages. RTL8723CS reports max_page = 2 and declares
support for sync train and secure connection, but it responds with
either garbage or with error in status on corresponding commands.
